		<p> There's nothing really special about me. I'm someone who enjoys my own sense of creativity like painting, photography, graphic design and such. You know, just the typical devcom student. That's why a lot of my peers says I'm crazy for taking CMSC courses 'cause everyone knows how difficult this subject could be... especially for those who's not really fond of codes, numbers and all. But I think CMSC is also an art on it's own. It's just like designing something out of codes and that's what I find amazing about it. </p>

		<h4> Expectation for the Subject</h4>
		<p> I've already taken CMSC 100 before and unfortunately I didn't make it at that time. I had a rough time towards the end but relatively it was really fun knowing those things. And since it has been almost 2 years since then, I've forgotten EVERYTHING. So I do hope that this semester, even if I know it would still be difficult, I'm hoping it would be as fun as it was before. And I hope this time I'll have a passing grade, of course. :) </p>

		<h4> Expectation for the Instructor</h4>
		<p> As I've mentioned, I've already taken this course before. I was actually under Sir Bulacs at that time and I loved how fun he was both in our lecture and laboratory classes. I was actually happy when someone gave me a tip that the instructor for this lab would be just as fun as my previous one and I really do hope it's true. I'm not really good in CMSC, you see... but I tend to learn more whenever I enjoy the classes itself. So far, I really think I've made the right choice to choose this section with regards to that wish of mine. :) </p>
